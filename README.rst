  Requires a legal version of SAMx's STRATAGem installed on a 
  Windows PC to work, including the USB dongle.

*stratagemtools* is a Python interface to SAMx's 
`STRATAGem <http://www.samx.com/microanalysis/products/stratagem_us.html>`_ 
program.
The interface allows, for example, to calculate k-ratios and compute film 
thickness in Python using the STRATAGem's OEM interface, i.e. without the
normal graphical interface.
It gives an object oriented approach to microanalysis calculations.

*stratagemtools* supports Python 3.x only.

The library is provided under the MIT license.

*stratagemtools* was developed as part of the doctorate thesis project of 
Philippe T. Pinard at RWTH Aachen University (Aachen, Germany) under the 
supervision of Dr. Silvia Richter.
